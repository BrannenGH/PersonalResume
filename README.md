# My Resume
All of the cool kids have their resume in version control, so why shouldn't I?

Plus I have a custom version of the mcdowellcv.cls that is years in the making at this point, so you are free to use that if you'd like (it avoids the weird three column headers in favor of two column headers, plus it also uses a seperate font for headers).
